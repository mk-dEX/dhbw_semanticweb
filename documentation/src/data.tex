\section{Structure and Usage of the Movie Ontology}
Our semantic search webpage should enable a user to search for movies or other associated artifacts, e.g. a particular genre or a film's most famous actors. Thus an ontology is required which puts all of those things in relation. We decided to adopt an existing ontology, called "MO - the Movie Ontology" \cite{bouza:movieontology}. It makes use of OWL to map movie entities to classes and defines class hierarchies as well as predicates that show their relationship. To describe its elements, it uses other well-known movie ontologies, e.g. "DBpedia" \cite{dbpedia}.
